# covid-19
attempting some covid dataviz. There are a number of [great dashboards](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) out there so this is just for my own personal pythoning.

## Data

John Hopkins is tracking a number of covid data sources and compliing them into daily updated easy to use csv files:
https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19

To use, add their data as a submodule:

`git submodule add https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19`

and update it daily to get the latest data:

`git submodule update --remote COVID-19`

## What this will contain
